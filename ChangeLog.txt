 - Libraries

 Language class library - Version 3.0.0

    1. This is the new generation of language class library.
       The main goal of refactoring is fast and flexible usage.

    2. The language content will not be loaded in instance until first item request.

    File: /tokernel.framework/lib/language.lib.php

 Pagination class library - Version 2.1.0

     1. New dynamic way to define base url.

         This is the rid of very big head pain for many developers.

         Old style base url:
           $base_url = 'http://localhost/my_project/addon/action/param1/param2/param3/';
           // The pagination library will add a page number to end of url:
           // http://localhost/my_project/addon/action/param1/param2/param3/1

         New option to develop:
           $base_url = 'http://localhost/my_project/addon/action/{var.offset}/param1/param2/param3/';
           // The pagination library will replace the {var.offset} in string with page number.
           // http://localhost/my_project/addon/action/1/param1/param2/param3/
           // http://localhost/my_project/addon/action/2/param1/param2/param3/
           // So, it is possible to add in any part of string.

         Notice: if the item {var.offset} in base url not exists,
         a page number will be added to the end of url like before.

     File: /tokernel.framework/lib/pagination.lib.php

 Validation (valid) class library - Version 1.4.0

     1. New method date() added.
         You can validate a date with your given format.

     2. In all methods excepts password_strength() and credit_card()
         if the validation passed, than 'true' will be returned instead ov actual data value.

     3. Method az_09() is deprecated. Instead you can use method alpha_numeric().

     File: tokernel.framework/lib/valid.lib.php

 Shopping cart class library - Version 1.0.2

    1. Some of class members changed to protected instead of old private.

    File: tokernel.framework/lib/shopping_cart.lib.php

 INI class library - Version 1.3.1

    1. Usage of method :
        $this->lib->array->array_key_rename(...)
       Changed to:
        $this->lib->array->key_rename(...)

    File: tokernel.framework/lib/ini.lib.php

 Form validation class library - Version 2.0.0

     The new generation of form validation class library available now with new rules and features.

     1. New rules added to validate:
		It is also possible to accept multiple values for validation.


     2. It is now possible to set custom messages to rules.

         Example:

         $rules = array(
             'car_model' => array(
                 'required' => true
             ),
             'device_model' => array(
                 'required' => true
             ),
         );

         $messages = array(
             'car_model' => array(
                 'required' => 'Please enter the model of your car!'
             )
         );

         // As you can see, the "car_model" have custom created message,
         // when the "device_model" will display default message from application language.

         $this->lib->form_validation->add_rules($rules, $messages);

     3. "required" rule should be defined for any required element.

         If the element value is required, the "required" rule should be defined.
         For example, you have a rule listed bellow and the value is empty,
         the validation will be passed as true:

         $rules = array(
             'email_address' => array(
                 'email' => true
             )
         );

         Instead, you have to add "required" rule too:

         $rules = array(
             'email_address' => array(
                 'email' => true,
                 'required' => true
             )
         );

         Because in practice we having a case when the value should be validated only if not empty.

     4. Define a new instance of form_validation library.

         It is now possible to define many instances of library with different rules.

         $rules_1 = array(...);
         $rules_2 = array(...);

         $fv_1 = $this->lib->form_validation->instance($rules_1);
         $fv_2 = $this->lib->form_validation->instance($rules_2);

         // So now, the $fv_2 and $fv_2 are different instances with different rules.

	 5. It is possible to validate any type of data instead of POST request only.

	    Example:

	    // Validate POST request data by default
	    $this->lib->form_validation->run();

	    // Validate PUT request data (this option works for REST API Development)
	    $this->lib->form_validation->run('PUT');

	    // Validate custom created array
	    $this->lib->form_validation->run($my_array);

     File: /tokernel.framework/lib/form_validation.lib.php

 Date class library - Version 2.0.0

     1. The methods in this library was successfully refactored.

     File: /tokernel.framework/lib/date.lib.php

 Array class library - Version 1.1.0

     1. New method key_by_pos() in library.
         Returns key from array by position.

     2. Method array_key_rename() is deprecated.
         Instead you can use key_rename() method.

     3. Method array_key_pos() is deprecated.
         Instead you can use key_pos() method.

     File: /tokernel.framework/lib/array.lib.php

 URL Class library - Version 4.1.0

     1. Dashes allowed in URLs
        New item added into application.ini file:
            http_allow_url_dashes=1

        With this option it will be possible to parse urls with dash
        and convert addon/action names to underscores for proper functionality.

        Example: http://localhost/my_project/addon-name-with-dashes/and-action-name/param-1/param-2
        Will parse as:
            addon: addon_name_with_dashes
            action: and_action_name
            params: param-1, param-2

        As you can see, the parameters parses as is.

        Notice: in routes configuration dashes is allowed by default.

 CLI (Command line interface) class library - Version 2.0.1

    1. Small bugs fixed.

    2. In toKernel 2.x method out() displays content with new line character.
        If you want to ignore new line, just set last argument to false.
        $this->lib->cli->out('my text', 'red', 'white', false);

	3. toKernel 2.x supports only English language in CLI and the method language_prefix() will always return 'en'.

	File: tokernel.framework/lib/cli.lib.php

 Template parsing class library - Version 3.0.0

    1. Because the templates directory and functionality removed from framework directory,
        all template files loading only from application/templates directory.

	3. If the required template file not exists in instance() method, the WARNING will be triggered.

	File: tokernel.framework/lib/template.lib.php

 Extended "shopping_cart" class library in application.

       This is an example to demonstrate you, how to extend class libraries.
       See usage:
           File: /application/addons/example/lib/example.addon.php

       File: application/lib/shopping_cart.ext.lib.php

 - Misc

 Application hooks - Version 2.0.0

	1. Now the application has only one hook file class library where you can add all your actions.

		Each action allows you to write actions in specific situation:
			before_run()
			after_run()
			cli_before_run()
			cli_after_run()
			http_before_run()
			http_after_run()
			http_before_output($output_buffer)
			http_after_output($output_buffer)

    2. You're able to manage application output buffer in HTTP mode with your own risk in method http_before_output()

	3. Hook class libraries including in kernel loader class instead of application's run() method.
